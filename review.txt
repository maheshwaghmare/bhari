I suspect you have un-minimized and minimized versions of your js and css files, but they appear in different directories? Please go through the WARNING's below and let me know.

FILE: bhari\assets\css\min\rtl\style.min-rtl.css
FILE: bhari\assets\css\min\style.min.css
FILE: bhari\assets\js\min\style.min.js
FILE: bhari\inc\assets\css\min\customizer-control-slider.min.css
FILE: bhari\inc\assets\css\min\jquery-ui-structure.min.css
FILE: bhari\inc\assets\css\min\jquery-ui-theme.min.css
FILE: bhari\inc\assets\js\min\customizer-control-slider.min.js
FILE: bhari\inc\assets\js\min\customizer.min.js
```
> Yes. We have created the separate directories for RTL and minified files to keep the clean development `css` and `js` directories.

If this is required then We'll do it.

If this is recommended then We'll do it in next release.
